## Type of Questions.

* Descriptive
* Exploratory
* Inferential
* Predictive
* Causal
* Mechanistic

### Descriptive

**Goals:** Describe a set of data
* the first kind of data analytics of performed
* Commounly applied census data
* the description and interpretation are diferent steps

### Exploratory Analisys.

**Goals:** Find relationships you din't know about

* Exploratory models are good for discovering new conecctions
* They are also useful for definig future studies
* Exploratory analyses are usually not the final say
* Exploratory analyses alons should not be used for generalized/predicting
* Correlation does not imply causation.

### Inferential Analisys.

**Goals:** Use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population.

* Inference is commonly the goal of stadistical models
* Inference involves estimating both the quantity you care about and your uncertainty about you estimate.
* Inference depends havility on both the population and the sampling scheme.

### Predictive Analisys

**Goals:** To use the data on some objects to predict values for another object

* If X predict Y its does not mean that X causes Y
* Accurate prediction depends heavility on measuring the right variables
* Althought there are better and worse prediction models, more data and simple model works really well.
* Prediction is very hard, especially about the future references.

### Causal Analisys.

**Goals:** To find out happens to one variable when you make another variable changue.

* Usually randomized studies are required to identify causation.
* They are approaches to inferring causation in no-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions
* Causal relationships are usually identify as average effects, but may not apply to every individual.
* Causal model are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis.

### Mechanistic Analisys

**Goals:** Understand the exact changes in variables, that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.

* Incredibly hard to infer, except in simple situations
* Usually modeled by a deterministic set of equations(phisicals / engeneering / science)
* Generally the random component of the data is measuriment error
* If the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may inrefed with data analysis
