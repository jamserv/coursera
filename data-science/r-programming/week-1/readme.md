## Quiz Week-1

**4. If I execute the expression x <- 4L in R, what is the class of the object 'x' as determined by the 'class()' function?**
>numeric

**5. What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?**
>numeric

**6. If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression rbind(x, y)?**
>a matrix with two rows and three columns

**7. A key property of vectors in R is that**
> elements of a vector all must be of the same class

**8. Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[2]] give me? Select all that apply.**
> a list containing character vector with the letter "a"

> **a character vector containing the letter "a".**

**9. Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?**
> a numeric vector with elements 3, 4, 5, 6.

**10. Suppose I have a vector x <- c(3, 5, 1, 10, 12, 6) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are less than 6 to be equal to zero. What R code achieves this? Select all that apply.**
> x[x < 6] <- 0.
> x[x <= 5] <- 0

**11. Use the Week 1 Quiz Data Set to answer questions 11-20. In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?**
> Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day
