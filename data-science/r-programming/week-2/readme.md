## Quiz Week-2

**1. Suppose I define the following function in R**
```
cube <- function(x, n) {
        x^3
}
cube(3)
```
**27**

**2. The following code will produce a warning in R.**
```
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
        x <- 0
}
```
* 'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single logical statement.
